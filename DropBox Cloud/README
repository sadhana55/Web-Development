The goal of this project is to develop a photo-album application that uses cloud storage. 
More specifically, you will use the Dropbox API to create a photo album, in which you can upload, delete, and browse photographs.

Develop a trivial photo-album application on Dropbox. 

1. Provide a form to upload a new image (a *.jpg). Look at the class slides for a PHP example that handles uploads.

2. A display window that lists the names of the images in your dropbox directory. 
For each image name you have a link that, when you click it, it downloads and displays the image in the image section. 
Each image name also has a button to delete this image from the dropbox storage.

3. An image section that displays the current image. 
You can change the image by changing the src attribute value of the <img ...> element

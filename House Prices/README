The goal of this project is to create a web mashup that combines two web services: Google Maps and the Zillow API, 
using JavaScript and AJAX. When you click on a house on the map, your application will display the postal address 
and the estimated price of the house.

For this project, you will use the

Real Estate API from the Zillow API (more specifically, GetSearchResults) https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm
Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding?csw=1 from the Google Maps JavaScript API
Google Map Markers - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers

To use Google Maps, you need to get an API key (you will need to login using your google account). 
To use the Zillow API, you need to register and obtain a web service ID from Zillow Web Services ID (ZWSID). 
After you get the twp API keys, you put them in map.html and map.js, you start your XAMPP web server, 
and you test your setup on your web browser by using the URL address http://localhost/project3/map.html 
and by typing the address of some existing house (example: 904 Austin St, Arlington, TX 76012). 

It will display the estimated value of this house (empty if the address is invalid).

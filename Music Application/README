This project is to develop a web application to get information about music artists, their albums, etc. 
This application is developed using plain JavaScript and Ajax. 

This application has a text window where one can type the artist name (eg, The Beatles). 
It should display:
1. the artist name, 
2. a link to the Last.fm web page of the artist, 
3. information about the artist (including a long biography), 
4. their picture (large), 
5. a list of their top albums (titles & pictures), 
6. and a list of names of similar artists. 

following Last.fm methods are used:

Get the metadata for an artist, including biography
Get the top albums for an artist
Get all the artists similar to this artist

You are going to use the Web Service REST API of the music application https://www.last.fm/.
You first need to get an API access key from Get an API Account at https://secure.last.fm/login?next=/api/account/create  . 
The access key will allow you to send web service requests to Last.fm (maximum 1 request per second).

After you get the API key, you put it in music.js and you test your setup on your web browser by using the URL address:
http://localhost/project2/music.html
and by typing the name of your favorite singer/band.

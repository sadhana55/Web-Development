The goal of this project is to learn XPath and XSLT to query XML data.

Use SigmodRecord.xml and SigmodRecord.dtd (the DTD of the document). for answering the XPath Queries

Print the titles of all articles whose one of the authors is David Maier.
Print the titles of all articles whose first author is David Maier.
Print the titles of all articles whose authors include David Maier and Stanley B. Zdonik.
Print the titles of all articles in volume 19/number 2.
Print the titles and the init/end pages of all articles in volume 19/number 2 whose authors include Jim Gray.
Print the volume and number of all articles whose authors include David Maier. (note: we need the number entry of an article, not the number of articles).

Consider the following XML document along with its DTD that describes recipes:
recipes.xml
recipes.dtd
Write an XSLT program recipe.xsl to display the recipes nicely on a web browser. 
The XSLT should generate HTML code. 
You should display all data except the related elements. 

Use the Java program xslt.java to test your XSLT and then load the resulting html output file on your web browser.

Consider the following XML document along with its DTD that describes auctions:

auction.zip (the zipped XML document)

It contains synthetic data (automatically generated). 
The words for text paragraphs are taken from Shakespeare's plays. 
There is also a DTD for the XML file but it is not very useful. 

Express the following queries using XQuery and run them against the file auction.xml:

Print the number of items listed on all continents.
List the names of items registered in Europe along with their descriptions.
List the names of persons and the number of items they bought.
List all persons according to their interest (ie, for each interest category, display the persons on that category).
Group persons by their categories of interest and output the size of each group.
List the names of persons and the names of the items they bought in Europe.
Give an alphabetically ordered list of all items along with their location.
List the reserve prices of those open auctions where a certain person with id person3 issued a bid before another person with id person6.
(Here before means "listed before in the XML document", that is, before in document order.)
